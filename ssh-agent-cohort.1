.Sh NAME
.Nm ssh-agent-cohort
.Nd provide a cohort ofSSH agents
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm ssh-agent-cohort
.Op Fl dh
.Ar sshagentsockdir
.Ar \-\-
.Ar cmd ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a program that when run multiple times, forms a cohort
that where member process instances cooperate to provide
access to an SSH agent via fixed path. This is useful when used
with
.Xr tmux 1
where sessions outlive individual SSH connections, and sessions
can be connected to zero, one, or more SSH connections at any
time.
.Pp
If environment variable SSH_AUTH_SOCK is absent,
.Nm
starts the command named by
.Ar cmd
using
.Xr execve 2 .
If the environment variable is present,
.Nm
forks a child that waits to lock the parent directory of
.Ar sshagentsockdir .
Once locked, a symlink named @ is created in
.Ar sshagentsockdir
is that points to the socket named
by the environment variable SSH_AUTH_SOCK.
.Pp
The directory named by
.Ar sshagentsockdir
must use an absolute path.
.Pp
The parent sets the environment variable SSH_AUTH_SOCK to
the symlink named @ created in
.Ar sshagentsockdir
before starting the command named by
.Ar cmd
using
.Xr execve 2 .
.Pp
The forked child process ignores SIGTERM, SIGINT,
SIGQUIT, and SIGHUP, and only terminates when the parent
process exits.
.Sh OPTIONS
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl d Fl \-debug
Print debugging information.
.It Fl h Fl \-help
Print help summary.
.El
.Sh EXIT STATUS
.Nm
mirrors the succesful exit status of the monitored process.
.Sh EXAMPLES
Start a
.Xr tmux 1
session with a remote host, and provide the session with
an SSH agent socket at
.Ar /tmp/tmux/agent :
.Pp
.Dl $ ssh remotehost ssh-standby-agent '/tmp/tmux.$UID/agent' tmux "$@"
